            Welcome to QuaverPvM! This is your first time playing, so here's
            what you need to know to get going. The instructions will disappear
            after a match, but will be available in the FAQ at any time.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Once you click on MATCH, you will be matched against a map.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After getting matched, you have 10 minutes to submit an S
                    rank play on the map. Mirror and higher rates are allowed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When your score is submitted to Quaver, you need to click
                    the SUBMIT button. Your recent plays will be scanned for a
                    valid play. If you're unable to submit an S rank play, then
                    you're free to resign with the RESIGN button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your rating is going to be hidden until you've finished your
                    10 placement matches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Feel free to check out the FAQ or ask questions in the
                    Discord.
                </li>

            Your Rating Deviation (currentlt {{ user.rd.toFixed(0) }} RD) is
            above 100, which means you're <b>unranked</b>. Once your RD is below
            100, you will receive a letter rank and appear on the leaderboards
            (coming soon!).
            <!-- TODO Edit when leaderboards are out -->
