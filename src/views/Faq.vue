                After getting matched against a map around your current rating,
                you will then have 10 minutes to submit an S Rank score or
                higher (&ge; 95.00% accuracy) in Quaver on that map. This also
                means that you're allowed to retry as long as you have time left
                to submit the score. If you're unable to get the S rank, then
                you can resign. Please make sure that you're playing the correct
                rate.

                Mirror mod is allowed. Rates below the provided map rate are not
                allowed. NF/NLN/FLN/INV mods and pausing are not allowed, as
                those will make your play not submit to the server. NSV is also
                not allowed, but not necessary because of the maps chosen to get
                added to QuaverPvM.

            <h1>Are the maps added to the database randomly?</h1>
            <p>
                No. A specific set of filters have been implemented: 4K only,
                map must be ranked, length between 2-5 minutes, &lt; 60% LN and
                no SVs in the map file. The initial rating of a map also scales
                off its Quaver difficulty and its initial RD is reduced to 200
                as opposed to 350. Please refer to the upcoming stats page for
                current thresholds.

            <h1>I played against a map that was over/underrated in rating!</h1>
            <p>
                This happens. Remember, a map's initial rating scales off Quaver
                difficulty rating, so it's as accurate as that when it hasn't
                played against anyone. It will get more accurate as more players
                play against it, so please play more!

            <h1>How does the rating work? / What is Glicko/RD?</h1>
            <p>
                The Glicko-2 system is a rating system that has a regular skill
                rating, but also considers how inaccurate the rating is by
                computing a value called rating deviation (RD). The more matches
                you play, the smaller RD becomes, which means that the system
                thinks your rating is more accurate. RD increases over time.

                Will I gain more rating if I win with a large accuracy lead /
                higher rate?
            </h1>
            <p>
                No, the Glicko-2 system only considers wins and losses as two
                results, no matter the accuracy or rate.

                Why do I have to play 10 matches before I can see any stats?
            </h1>
            <p>
                The RD is the largest for an unranked player, which means that
                the rating will fluctuate a lot at the beginning. This can lead
                to false expectations, so you need to play a few matches until
                the system can be sure that your rating is roughly accurate.

                I played 10 matches and see my Glicko rating, but I don't have a
                letter rank yet?
            </h1>
            <p>
                While you need to play 10 matches to see your Glicko rating,
                once you see them does not mean that you are ranked. You will be
                ranked as soon as you get a letter rank, which requires having
                100 RD or less. Once you have it, you will be considered in the
                leaderboards. Only one way to get there: play more matches.

            <h1>What does my letter rank mean?</h1>
            <p>
                Your letter rank is determined by the current percentile you're
                currently in. This means that for example at rank #150 of 2000
                players, you would be in the 7.5th percentile, which is
                considered SS rank. The thresholds are the same as in
                <a href="https://tetr.io/">Tetr.io</a> and as following:
