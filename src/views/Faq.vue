                After getting matched against a map around your current rating,
                you will then have 10 minutes to submit a score in Quaver on
                that map. This also means that you're allowed to retry as long
                as you have time left to submit the score. Mirror mod is
                allowed. Rates below 1.0x are not allowed. NF/NLN/FLN/INV mods
                and pausing are not allowed, as those will make your play not
                submit to the server. NSV is also not allowed, but not necessary
                because of the maps chosen to get added to QuaverPvM.

                No. A specific set of filters have been implemented: 4K only,
                map must be ranked, length between 2-5 minutes, &lt; 60% LN and
                no SVs in the map file. The initial rating of a map also scales
                off its Quaver difficulty done with linear approximation and its
                initial RD is reduced to 200 as opposed to 350.

            <p>
                QuaverPvM roughly adapts the system that
                <a href="https://tetr.io/">Tetr.io</a> currently uses, which is
                Glicko+GLIXARE and percentile ranks.

            <p>
                QLIXARE (QXE) is a term I made up to describe the rating used on
                this QuaverPvM. It scales off the
                <a

                system, based on the change of beating a random unranked player,
                which is computed from a Glicko Rating and Rating Deviation.
                GLIXARE has been scaled to 0-25000 for QXE, with 12500 being the
                average. This is the same scaling
                <a href="https://tetr.io/">Tetr.io</a> uses for its Tetra
                Rating.

            <h1>What is Glicko?</h1>
            <p>
                The Glicko-2 system is a rating system that has a regular skill
                rating, but also considers how inaccurate the rating is by
                computing a value called rating deviation (RD). The more matches
                you play, the smaller RD becomes, which means that the system
                thinks your rating is more accurate. RD increases over time.

                Why do I have to play 10 matches before I can see any stats?
            </h1>
            <p>
                The RD is the largest for an unranked player, which means that
                the rating will fluctuate a lot at the beginning. This can lead
                to false expectations, so you need to play a few matches until
                the system can be sure that your rating is roughly accurate.

            <h1>What does my letter rank mean?</h1>
            <p>
                Your letter rank is determined by the current percentile you're
                currently in (based on GLIXARE). This means that for example at
                rank #150 of 2000 players, you would be considered in the 7.5th
                percentile, which would be considered SS rank. The thresholds
                are the same as in <a href="https://tetr.io/">Tetr.io</a> and as
                following:
