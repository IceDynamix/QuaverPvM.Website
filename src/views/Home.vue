                <h3>Rating System</h3>
                <p>
                    Glicko-2 rating system applied to a PvE environment. Your
                    rating and the map's rating change after each match. The
                    system takes rating inaccuracy over time into account. It's
                    destined to become the best skill and difficulty measurement
                    system over time.

                <h3>Skill Range</h3>
                <p>
                    Get map "recommendations" in your skill range. You'll always
                    have something challenging to play. The rating system will
                    make sure it's mostly accurate, and if it's not, then the
                    outcome will make sure that it becomes more accurate over
                    time.
